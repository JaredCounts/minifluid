# minifluid
Simple liquid simulator

Most of the math will be based on Nick Foster and Ron Fedkiw's paper, "Practical Animation of Liquid." http://physbam.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/papers/stanford2001-02.pdf

Right now this is proof of concept. I'd like the code to be as clean as possible, but at a sacrifice there's going to be a lot of opportunities lost to cache and re-use space in memory.
